                <p>The Best AirPlane Encyclopedia you'll ever find!</p>
                <p>AirPedia will explain everything you need to know about Airplanes and with our wide gallery of photos you'll also get to look at individual specs for each plane you search!</p>
                <p>Dont know how fast a plane is? Or the weight of a certain Rotary-Wing just search it and thats it.</p>
                <p>You can even sort them by size, speed or even weight!</p>
                <p>Don't know the name of a plane, search the specs!</p>
                <p>Don't understand how aircrafts acheive lift, this website will explain how both the engine and wings work together to carry over 75tons over 8,500miles.</p>
